0,"No , forget it , it is too risky . I am through doing that shit ."
1,"You always say that , the same thing every time : never again , I am through , too dangerous ."
2,"I know that is what I always say . I am always right too , but –"
3,"yeah , well , the day of me forgitting are over , and the day of me remembering have just begun ."
4,"When you go on like this , you know what you sound like ?"
5,"I sound like a sensible fucking man , is what I sound like ."
6,You sound like a duck .
7,"Quack , quack , quack , quack , quack , quack , quack ..."
8,"Well take heart , 'cause you are never gon na hafta hear it again . Because since I am never gon na do it again , you are never gon na hafta hear me quack about how I am never gon na do it again ."
9,After tonight .
10,Correct . I got all tonight to quack .
11,Can I get anybody anymore coffee ?
12,"Oh yes , thank you ."
13,I am doing fine .
14,"I mean the way it is now , you are taking the same fucking risk a when you rob a bank . You take more of a risk . Banks are easier ! Federal bank are not supposed to stop you anyway , during a robbery . They are insured , why should they care ? You do not even need a gun in a federal bank . I heard about this guy , walked into a federal bank with a portable phone , handed the phone to the teller , the guy on the other end of the phone said : `` We got this guy is little girl , and if you do not give him all your money , we are gon na kill 'er . ''"
15,Did it work ?
16,"Fucking A it worked , that is what I am talking about ! Knucklehead walk in a bank with a telephone , not a pistol , not a shotgun , but a fucking phone , clean the place out , and they do not lift a fucking finger ."
17,Did they hurt the little girl ?
18,I do not know . There probably never wa a little girl – the point of the story is not the little girl . The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone .
19,You wan na rob bank ?
20,"I am not saying I wan na rob bank , I am just illustrating that if we did , it would be easier than what we been doin ' ."
21,So you do not want to be a bank robber ?
22,"Naw , all those guy are going down the same road , either dead or serving twenty ."
23,And no more liquor store ?
24,"What have we been talking about ? Yeah , no- more-liquor-stores . Besides , it ai not the giggle it usta be . Too many foreigner own liquor store . Vietnamese , Koreans , they can not fucking speak English . You tell 'em : `` Empty out the register , '' and they do not know what it fucking mean . They make it too personal . We keep on , one of those gook motherfucker ' gon na make u kill 'em ."
25,I am not gon na kill anybody .
26,"I do not wan na kill anybody either . But they will probably put u in a situation where it is u of them . And if it is not the gook , it these old Jews who have owned the store for fifteen fucking generation . Ya got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the counter with a fucking Magnum . Try walking into one of those store with nothing but a telephone , see how far it get you . Fuck it , forget it , we are out of it ."
27,"Well , what else is there , day job ?"
28,( laughing ) Not this life .
29,Well what then ?
30,Garcon ! Coffee !
31,This place .
32,( snotty ) `` Garcon '' mean boy .
33,"Correct . Just like bank , these place are insured . The manager do not give a fuck , they are just trying to get ya out the door before you start plugging diner ."
34,"Waitresses , forget it , they ai not taking a bullet for the register . Busboys , some wetback getting paid a dollar fifty a hour gon na really give a fuck you are stealing from the owner . Customers are sitting there with food in their mouth , they do not know what is going on . One minute they are having a Denver omelette , next minute somebody is sticking a gun in their face ."
35,"See , I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up . 'Member all those customer kept coming in ?"
36,They you got the idea to take everybody is wallet .
37,That wa a good idea .
38,Thanks .
39,We made more from the wallet then we did the register .
40,Yes we did .
41,A lot of people go to restaurant .
42,A lot of wallet .
43,"Pretty smart , huh ?"
44,Pretty smart .
45,"I am ready , let is go , right here , right now ."
46,"Remember , same a before , you are crowd control , I handle the employee ."
47,Got it .
48,"I love you , Pumpkin ."
49,"I love you , Honey Bunny ."
50,Everybody be cool this is a robbery !
51,Any of you fucking prick move and I will execute every one of you motherfucker ! Got that ?
52,"– Okay now , tell me about the hash bar ?"
53,What so you want to know ?
54,"Well , hash is legal there , right ?"
55,"Yeah , it is legal , but is ai not a hundred percent legal . I mean you can not walk into a restaurant , roll a joint , and start puffing away . You are only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated place ."
56,Those are hash bar ?
57,"Yeah , it break down like this : it is legal to buy it , it is legal to own it and , if you are the proprietor of a hash bar , it is legal to sell it . It is legal to carry it , which doe not really matter 'cause – get a load of this – if the cop stop you , it is illegal for this to search you . Searching you is a right that the cop in Amsterdam do not have ."
58,"That did it , man – I am fucking goin ' , that is all there is to it ."
59,You will dig it the most . But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is ?
60,What ?
61,"It is the little difference . A lotta the same shit we got here , they got there , but there they are a little different ."
62,Examples ?
63,"Well , in Amsterdam , you can buy beer in a movie theatre . And I do not mean in a paper cup either . They give you a glass of beer , like in a bar . In Paris , you can buy beer at MacDonald is . Also , you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris ?"
64,They do not call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese ?
65,"No , they got the metric system there , they would not know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is ."
66,What would they call it ?
67,Royale with Cheese .
68,Royale with Cheese . What would they call a Big Mac ?
69,"Big Mac is a Big Mac , but they call it Le Big Mac ."
70,Le Big Mac . What do they call a Whopper ?
71,"I dunno , I did not go into a Burger King . But you know what they put on french fry in Holland instead of ketchup ?"
72,What ? Mayonnaise . Goddamn !
73,"I seen 'em do it . And I do not mean a little bit on the side of the plate , they fucking drown 'em in it ."
74,Uuccch !
75,We should have shotgun for this kind of deal .
76,How many up there ?
77,Three or four .
78,Counting our guy ?
79,I am not sure .
80,So there could be five guy up there ?
81,It is possible .
82,We should have fucking shotgun .
83,What is her name ?
84,Mia .
85,How did Marsellus and her meet ?
86,"I dunno , however people meet people . She usta be an actress ."
87,She ever do anything I woulda saw ?
88,I think her biggest deal wa she starred in a pilot .
89,What is a pilot ?
90,"Well , you know the show on TV ?"
91,I do not watch TV .
92,"Yes , but you are aware that there is an invention called television , and on that invention they show show ?"
93,Yeah .
94,"Well , the way they pick the show on TV is they make one show , and that show is called a pilot . And they show that one show to the people who pick the show , and on the strength of that one show , they decide if they want to make more show . Some get accepted and become TV program , and some do not , and become nothing . She starred in one of the one that became nothing ."
95,"You remember Antwan Rockamora ? Half-black , half-Samoan , usta call him Tony Rocky Horror ."
96,"Yeah maybe , fat right ?"
97,"I would not go so far a to call the brother fat . He is got a weight problem . What is the nigger gon na do , he is Samoan ."
98,"I think I know who you mean , what about him ?"
99,"Well , Marsellus fucked his as up good . And word around the campfire , it wa on account of Marsellus Wallace is wife ."
100,"What would he do , fuck her ?"
101,"No no no no no no no , nothing that bad ."
102,Well what then ?
103,He gave her a foot massage .
104,That is all ?
105,What did Marsellus do ?
106,"Sent a couple of guy over to his place . They took him out on the patio of his apartment , threw his as over the balcony . Nigger fell four story . They had this garden at the bottom , enclosed in glass , like one of them greenhouse – nigger fell through that . Since then , he is kinda developed a speech impediment ."
107,That is a damn shame .
108,"Still I hafta say , play with match , ya get burned ."
109,Whaddya mean ?
110,You do not be giving Marsellus Wallace is new bride a foot massage .
111,You do not think he overreacted ?
112,"Antwan probably did not expect Marsellus to react like he did , but he had to expect a reaction ."
113,"It wa a foot massage , a foot massage is nothing , I give my mother a foot massage ."
114,"It is laying hand on Marsellus Wallace is new wife in a familiar way . Is it a bad a eating her out – no , but you are in the same fucking ballpark ."
115,JULES
116,"Whoa ... whoa ... whoa ... stop right there . Eating a bitch out , and giving a bitch a foot massage ai not even the same fucking thing ."
117,"Not the same thing , the same ballpark ."
118,"It ai not no ballpark either . Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine , but touching his lady is foot , and sticking your tongue in her holyiest of holyies , ai not the same ballpark , ai not the same league , ai not even the same fucking sport . Foot massage do not mean shit ."
119,Have you ever given a foot massage ?
120,Do not be telling me about foot massage – I am the foot fucking master .
121,Given a lot of 'em ?
122,"Shit yeah . I got my technique down man , I do not tickle or nothin ' ."

125,Would you give me a foot massage – I am kinda tired .
126,"Man , you best back off , I am gitting pissed"
127,– this is the door .
128,What time is it ?
129,( checking his watch ) Seven-twenty-two in the morning .
130,"It ai not quite time , let is hang back ."
131,"Look , just because I would not give no man a foot massage , do not make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass-motherfuckin-house , fucking up the way the nigger talk . That ai not right , man . Motherfucker do that to me , he better paralyze my as , 'cause I would kill ' a motherfucker ."
132,"I am not saying he wa right , but you are saying a foot massage do not mean nothing , and I am saying it doe . I have given a million lady a million foot massage and they all meant somethin ' . We act like they do not , but they do . That is what is so fucking cool about 'em . This sensual thing is going on that nobody is talkin about , but you know"
133,"it and she know it , fuckin'Marsellus knew it , and Antwan shoulda known fucking better . That is his fucking wife , man . He ai not gon na have a sense of humor about that shit ."
134,"That is an interesting point , but let is get into character ."
135,What is her name again ?
136,Mia . Why you so interested in big man is wife ?
137,"Well , Marsellus is leaving for Florida and when he is gone , he want me to take care of Mia ."
138,Take care of her ?
139,Not that ! Take her out . Show her a good time . Do not let her get lonely .
140,You are gon na be takin'MIA Wallace out on a date ?
141,It ai not a date . It is like when you and your buddy is wife go to a movie or somethin ' . It is just ... you know ... good company .
142,It is not a date .

216,"There is a passage I got memorized , seems appropriate for this situation : Ezekiel 25:17 . `` The path of the righteous man is beset on all side by the inequity of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men . Blessed is he who , in the name of charity and good will , shepherd the weak through the valley of darkness , for he is truly his brother is keeper and the finder of lost child . And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brother . And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you . ''"
217,"I think you are gon na find – when all this shit is over and done – I think you are gon na find yourself one smiling motherfucker . Thing is Butch , right now you got ability . But painful a it may be , ability do not last . Now that is a hard motherfucking fact of life , but it is a fact of life your as is gon na hafta git realistic about . This business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfucker who thought their as aged like wine ."
218,"Besides , even if you went all the way , what would you be ? Feather-weight champion of the world . Who give a shit ? I doubt you can even get a credit card based on that ."
219,"Now the night of the fight , you may fell a slight sting , that is pride fucking wit ya . Fuck pride ! Pride only hurt , it never help . Fight through that shit . 'Cause a year from now , when you are kicking it in the Caribbean you are gon na say , `` Marsellus Wallace wa right . ''"

One through the nipple on my left breast . One through my right nostril . One through my left eyebrow . One through my lip . One in my clit . And I wear a stud in my tongue ."

Sommerset had a photographic memory , the Japanese fox wa a kung fu master , the black girl wa a demolition expert , the French fox ' specialty wa sex ..."
327,What wa your specialty ?
328,"Knives . The character I played , Raven McCoy , her background wa she wa raised by circus performer . So she grew up doing a knife act . According to the show , she wa the deadliest woman in the world with a knife . But because she grew up in a circus , she wa also something of an acrobat . She could do illusion , she wa a trapeze artist – when you are keeping the world safe from evil , you never know when being a trapeze artist is gon na come in handy . And she knew a zillion old joke her grandfather , an old vaudevillian , taught her . If we woulda got picked up , they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode I woulda told and ol joke ."
329,Do you remember any of the joke ?

355,"I do not think we are there yet . But do not feel bad , we just met each other ."
356,"Well I will tell you what , I will go to the bathroom and powder my nose , while you sit here and think of something to say ."
357,I will do that .
358,( imitating Steppenwolf ) I said goddamn !
359,Do not you love it when you go to the bathroom and you come back to find your food waiting for you ?
360,We are lucky we got it at all . Buddy Holly doe not seem to be much of a waiter . We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe is section .
361,"Which one , there is two Marilyn Monroes ."
362,No there is not .
363,That is Marilyn Monroe ...
364,"... and that is Mamie Van Doren . I do not see Jayne Mansfield , so it must be her night off ."
365,Pretty smart .
366,I have moment .
367,Did ya think of something to say ?
368,"Actually , there is something I have wanted to ask you about , but you seem like a nice person , and I did not want to offend you ."
369,"Oooohhhh , this doe not sound like mindless , boring , getting-to-know-you chit-chat . This sound like you actually have something to say ."
370,Only if you promise not to get offended .
371,"You can not promise something like that . I have no idea what you are gon na ask . You could ask me what you are gon na ask me , and my natural response could be to be offended . Then , through no fault of my own , I woulda broken my promise ."
372,Then let is just forget it .
373,That is an impossibility . Trying to forget anything a intriguing a this would be an exercise in futility .
374,Is that a fact ?
375,"Besides , it is more exciting when you do not have permission ."
376,What do you think about what happened to Antwan ?
377,Who is Antwan ?
378,Tony Rocky Horror .
379,He fell out of a window .
380,"That is one way to say it . Another way is , he wa thrown out . Another wa is , he wa thrown out by Marsellus . And even another way is , he wa thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you ."
381,Is that a fact ?
382,"No it is not , it is just what I heard ."
383,Who told you this ?
384,They .
385,"They talk a lot , do not they ?"
386,They certainly do .
387,"Well do not by shyVincent , what exactly did they say ?"
388,"Let me help you Bashful , did it involve the F-word ?"
389,No . They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage .
390,And ... ?
391,"No and , that is it ."
392,You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror out of a four-story window because he massaged my foot ?
393,And you believed that ?
394,"At the time I wa told , it seemed reasonable ."
395,Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four- story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable ?
396,"No , it seemed excessive . But that doe not mean it did not happen . I heard Marsellus is very protective of you ."
397,A husband being protective of his wife is one thing . A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife is foot is something else .
398,But did it happen ?
399,"The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine wa my hand , when he shook it . I met Anwan once – at my wedding – then never again ."
400,"The truth is , nobody know why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror . But when you scamp get together , you are worse than a sewing circle ."
401,"Ladies and gentleman , now the moment you have all been waiting for , the world- famous Jackrabbit Slim is twist contest ."
402,... One lucky couple will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding .
403,"... Now , who will be our first contestant ?"
404,Right here .
405,I wan na dance .
406,"No , no , no no , no , no , no , no ."
407,"No , no , no , no , no , no , no . I do believe Marsellus , my husband , your bos , told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted , Now , I want to dance . I want to win . I want that trophy ."
408,( sigh ) All right .
409,"So , dance good ."
410,"All right , you asked for it ."
411,Let is hear it for our first contestant .
412,"Now let is meet our first contestant here this evening . Young lady , what is your name ?"
413,( into microphone ) Missus Mia Wallace .
414,"And , uh , how 'bout your fella here ?"
415,( into microphone ) Vincent Vega .
416,"All right , let is see what you can do . Take it away !"
417,Was than an uncomfortable silence ?
418,Music and drink !
419,I am gon na take a piss .
420,"That wa a little bit more information than I needed to know , but for right ahead ."
421,"( like you would say Bingo ! ) Disco ! Vince , you little cola nut , you have been holding out on me ."
422,"One drink and leave . Do not be rude , but drink your drink quickly , say goodbye , walk out the door , get in your car , and go down the road ."
423,"... It is a moral test of yourself , whether or not you can maintain loyalty . Because when people are loyal to each other , that is very meaningful ."
424,"So you are gon na go out there , drink your drink , say `` Goodnight , I have had a very lovely evening , '' go home , and jack off . And that is all you are gon na do ."
425,Jesus Christ !
426,Mia ! MIA ! What the hell happened ?

428,"Mia ! MIA ! What did you take ? Answer me honey , what did you take ?"

435,I told 'em and that is what I am gon na tell this fucking asshole right now !
436,"Hello , do you know how late it is ? You are not supposed to be calling me this fucking late ."
437,"Lance , this is Vincent , I am in big fucking trouble man , I am on my way to your place ."
438,"Whoa , hold you horse man , what is the problem ?"
439,You still got an adrenalin shot ?

441,"I need it man , I got a chick she is fucking ODing on me ."
442,"Do not bring her here ! I am not even fucking joking with you , do not you be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt to my house !"
443,No choice .

447,Negative .
448,"She ai not my fucking problem , you fucked her up , you deal with it – are you talking to me on a cellular phone ?"
449,Sorry .
450,"I do not know you , who is this , do not come here , I am hanging up ."
451,"Too late , I am already here ."
452,What the hell wa that ?
453,Have you lost your mind ? ! You crashed your car in my fucking house ! You talk about drug shit on a cellular fucking phone –
454,"If you are through having your little hissy fit , this chick is dyin ' , get your needle and git it now !"
455,Are you deaf ? You are not bringing that fucked up bitch in my house !
456,"This fucked up bitch is Marsellus Wallace is wife . Now if she fucking croak on me , I am a grease spot . But before he turn me into a bar soap , I am gon na be forced to tell 'im about how you coulda saved her life , but instead you let her die on your front lawn ."
457,It is only one-thirty in the goddamn mornin ' ! What the fuck is going on out here ?
458,Get that black box in the bedroom I have with the adrenalin shot .
459,What is wrong with her ?
460,She is ODing on u .
461,Well get her the hell outta here !
462,( in stereo ) Get the fucking shot !
463,Do not yell and me !
464,You two are a match made in heaven .
465,"Look , just keep talking to her , okay ? While she is getting the shot , I got ta get a medical book ."
466,What do you need a medical book for ?
467,To tell me how to do it . I have never given an adrenalin shot before .
468,You have had that thing for six year and you never used it ?
469,"I never had to use it . I do not go joy- popping with bubble-gummers , all of myfriends can handle their high !"
470,Well then get it .
471,"I am , if you will let me ."
472,I am not fucking stopping you .

481,My black fucking medical book . It is like a text book they give to nurse .
482,I never saw a medical book .
483,"Trust me , I have one ."
484,"Well if it is that important , why did not you keep it with the shot ?"
485,I do not know ! Stop bothering me !
486,"While you are looking for it , that girl is gon na die on our carpet . You are never gon na find it in all this shit . For six month now , I have been telling you to clean this room –"
487,Quit fucking around man and give her the shot !
488,"While I am doing this , take her shirt off and find her heart ."
489,Does it have to be exact ?
490,"Yeah , it ha to be exact ! I am giving her an injection in the heart , so I got ta exactly hit her in the heart ."
491,"Well , I do not know exactly where her heart is , I think it is here ."
492,That is it .
493,"I need a big fat magic marker , got one ?"
494,What ?
495,"I need a big fat magic marker , any felt pen will do , but a magic marker would be great ."
496,Hold on .
497,"It is ready , I will tell you what to do ."
498,You are gon na give her the shot .
499,"No , you are gon na give her the shot ."
500,I have never doe this before .
501,"I have never done this before either , and I ai not starting now . You brought 'er here , that mean you give her the shot . The day I bring an ODing bitch to your place , then I got ta give her the shot ."
502,Got it .
503,"Okay , what do I do ?"
504,"Well , you are giving her an injection of adrenalin straight to her heart . But she is got a breast plate in front of her heart , so you got ta pierce through that . So what you got ta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion ."
505,I got ta stab her ?
506,"If you want the needle to pierce through to her heart , you got ta stab her hard ."
507,"Then once you do , push down on the plunger ."
508,What happens after that ?
509,I am curious about that myself .
510,This ai not a fucking joke man !
511,– that .
512,Count to three .

516,"If you are okay , say something ."
517,Something .
518,Anybody want a beer ?
519,What are your thought on how to handle this ?
520,I seriously doubt that .
521,"If you can keep a secret , so can I ."
522,Let is shake on it .
523,Mum is the word .
524,"If you will excuse me , I got ta go home and have a heart attack ."
525,You still wan na hear my `` FOX FORCE FIVE '' joke ?
526,"Sure , but I think I am still a little too petrified to laugh ."
527,"Uh-huh . You will not laugh because it is not funny . But if you still wan na hear it , I will tell it ."
528,I can not wait .
529,"Three tomato are walking down the street , a poppa tomato , a momma tomato , and a little baby tomato . The baby tomato is lagging behind the poppa and momma tomato . The poppa tomato get mad , go over to the momma tomato and stamp on him"
530,– and say : catch up .
531,"See ya 'round , Vince ."
532,Butch .
533,"Butch , stop watching TV a second . We got a special visitor . Now do you remember when I told you your daddy dy in a P.O.W . camp ?"
534,Well this here is Capt . Koons . He wa in the P.O.W . camp with Daddy .
535,"Hello , little man . Boy I sure heard a bunch about you . See , I wa a good friend of your Daddy is . We were in that Hanoi pit of hell over five year together ."
536,"Hopefully , you will never have to experience this yourself , but when two men are in a situation like me and your Daddy were , for a long a we were , you take on certain responsibility of the other . If it had been me who had not made it , Major Coolidge would be talking right now to my son Jim . But the way it worked out is I am talking to you , Butch . I got something for ya ."
537,"This watch I got here wa first purchased by your great-granddaddy . It wa bought during the First World War in a little general store in Knoxville , Tennessee . It wa bought by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge the day he set sail for Paris . It wa your great-granddaddy is war watch , made by the first company to ever make wrist watch . You see , up until then , people just carried pocket watch . Your great-granddaddy wore that watch every day he wa in the war . Then when he had done his duty , he went home to your great- grandmother , took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol ' coffee can . And in that can it stayed notil your grandfather Dane Coolidge wa called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again . This time they called it World War Two . Your great-granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck ."
538,"Unfortunately , Dane is luck wa not a good a his old man is . Your granddad wa a"
539,"Marine and he wa killed with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island . Your granddad wa facing death and he knew it . None of those boy had any illusion about ever leaving that island alive . So three day before the Japanese took the island , your 22-year old grandfather asked a gunner on an Air Force transport named Winocki , a man he had never met before in his life , to deliver to his infant son , who he had never seen in the flesh , his gold watch . Three day later , your grandfather wa dead . But Winocki kept his word . After the war wa over , he paid a visit to your grandmother , delivering to your infant father , his Dad is gold watch . This watch . This watch wa on your Daddy is wrist when he wa shot down over Hanoi . He wa captured and put in a Vietnamese prison camp . Now he knew if the gook ever saw the watch it is be confiscated . The way your Daddy looked at it , that watch wa your birthright . And he would be damned if and slopeheads were gon na put their greasy yella hand on his boy is birthright . So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin ' . His as . Five long year , he wore this watch up his as . Then when he died of disentary , he gave me the watch . I hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my as for two year . Then , after seven year , I wa sent home to my family . And now , little man , I give the watch to you ."
540,"It is time , Butch ."
541,I am ready .
542,"– Well Dan , that had to be the bloodiest and , hands-down , the most brutal fight this city ha ever seen ."
543,... Coolidge wa out of there faster than I have ever seen a victorious boxer vacate the ring . Do you think he knew Willis wa dead ?
544,"My guess would be yes , Richard . I could see from my position here , the frenzy in his eye give way to the realization of what he wa doing . I think any man would have left the ring that fast ."
545,Do you feel this ring death tragedy will have an effect on the world of boxing ?
546,"Oh Dan , a tragedy like this can not help but shake the world of boxing to it very foundation . But it is of paramount importance that during the sad week ahead , the eye of the W.B.A . remain firmly fixed on the – CLICK –"
547,Are you the man I wa supposed to pick up ?
548,"If you are the cab I called , I am the guy you are supposed to pick up ."
549,Where to ?
550,Outta here .

552,Great . I never thanked you for the dinner .

554,He booked .
555,"I am prepared to scour the earth for this motherfucker . If Butch go to Indo China , I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice , ready to pop a cap in his as ."
556,I will take care of it .
557,"Hey , how do I open the window back here ?"
558,I have to do it .
559,"Hey , mister ?"
560,What ?
561,You were in that fight ? The fight on the radio – you are the fighter ?
562,Whatever gave you that idea ?
563,"No c amon , you are him , I know you are him , tell me you are him ."
564,( drying himself with a gym towel ) I am him .
565,You killed the other boxing man .
566,He is dead ?
567,The radio said he wa dead .
568,"( to himself ) Sorry 'bout that , Floyd ."
569,What doe it feel like ?
570,( find his shirt ) What doe what feel like ?
571,Killing a man . Beating another man to death with your bare hand .
572,Are you some kinda weirdo ?
573,"No , it is a subject I have much interest in . You are the first person I ever met who ha killed somebody . So , what wa it like to kill a man ?"
574,"Tell ya what , you give me one of them cigarette , I will give you an answer ."
575,Deal !
576,So ...
577,... Esmarelda Villalobos – is that Mexican ?
578,"The name is Spanish , but I am Columbian ."
579,It is a very pretty name .
580,It mean `` Esmarelda of the wolf . ''
581,"That is one hell of a name you got there , sister ."
582,Thank you . And what is your name ?
583,Butch .
584,Butch . What doe it mean ?
585,"I am an American , our name do not mean shit . Anyway , moving right along , what is it you wan na know , Esmarelda ?"
586,I want to know what it feel like to kill a man –
587,"– I could not tell ya . I did not know he wa dead notil you told me he wa dead . Now I know he is dead , do you wan na know how I feel about it ?"
588,I do not feel the least little bit bad .
589,"What is I tell ya , soon a the word got out a fix wa in , the odds would be outta control . Hey , if he wa a better fighter he is be alive . If he never laced up his glove in the first place , which he never shoulda done , he would be alive . Enough about the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd , let is talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch ."
590,How many bookie you spread it around with ?
591,"So by tomorrow evening , you will have it all ?"
592,"Good news Scotty , real good news – I understand a few straggler aside . Me ang Fabienne are gon na leave in the morning . It should take u a couple day to get into Knoxville . Next time we see each other , it will be on Tennessee time ."
593,"Fabienne my love , our adventure begin ."
594,Forty-five sixty .
595,Merci beaucoup . And here is a little something for the effort .
596,"Now if anybody should ask you about who your fare wa tonight , what are you gon na tell 'em ?"
597,"The truth . Three well-dressed , slightly toasted , Mexicans ."
598,"Bon soir , Esmarelda ."
599,"( in Spanish ) Sleep well , Butch ."
600,Keep the light off .
601,"Is that better , sugar pop ?"
602,Oui . Hard day at the office ?
603,Pretty hard . I got into a fight .
604,Poor baby . Can we make spoon ?
605,I wa looking at myself in the mirror .
606,Uh-huh ?
607,I wish I had a pot .
608,You were looking in the mirror and you wish you had some pot ?
609,A pot . A pot belly . Pot belly are sexy .
610,"Well you should be happy , 'cause you do ."
611,"Shut up , Fatso ! I do not have a pot ! I have a bit of a tummy , like Madonna when she did `` Lucky Star , '' it is not the same thing ."
612,I did not realize there wa a difference between a tummy and a pot belly .
613,The difference is huge .
614,You want me to have a pot ?
615,"No . Pot belly make a man look either oafish , or like a gorilla . But on a woman , a pot belly is very sexy . The rest of you is normal . Normal face , normal leg , normal hip , normal as , but with a big , perfectly round pot belly . If I had one , I would wear a tee-shirt two size too small to accentuate it ."
616,You think guy would find that attractive ?
617,I do not give a damn what men find attractive . It is unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same .
618,"If I had a pot belly , I would punch you in it ."
619,You would punch me in my belly ?
620,Right in the belly .
621,I would smother you . I would drop it on your right on your face notil you could not breathe .
622,You would do that to me ?
623,Yes !
624,"Did you get everything , sugar pop ?"
625,"Yes , I did . Good job ."
626,Did everything go a planned ?
627,You did not listen to the radio ?
628,I never listen to your fight . Were you the winner ?
629,I won alright .
630,Are you still retiring ?
631,Sure am .
632,What about the man you fought ?
633,Floyd retired too .
634,Really ? ! He will not be fighting no more ? !
635,Not no more .
636,So it all worked out in the finish ?
637,"We ai not at the finish , baby ."
638,"We are in a lot of danger , are not we ?"
639,"If they find u , they will kill u , will not they ?"
640,"But they will not find u , will they ?"
641,Do you still want me to go with you ?
642,I do not want to be a burden or a nuisance
643,"Fabienne , I want you to be with me ."
644,Forever ?
645,... and ever .
646,Do you love me ?
647,Oui .

658,"Okay , sorry , sorry , sorry , I take it back ! Can I have a towel please , Miss Beautiful Tulip ."
659,"Oh I like that , I like being called a tulip . Tulip is much better than Mongoloid ."
660,"I did not call you a Mongoloid , I called you a retard , but I took it back ."
661,Merci beaucoup .
662,"Yes , lemon pie ."
663,Where are we going to go ?
664,"I am not sure yet . Wherever you want . We are gon na get a lot of money from this . But it ai not gon na be so much , we can live like hog in the fat house forever . I wa thinking we could go somewhere in the South Pacific . The kinda money we will have will carry u a long way down there ."
665,"So if we wanted , we could live in Bora Bora ?"
666,"You betcha . And if after awhile you do not dig Bora Bora , then we can move over to Tahiti or Mexico ."
667,But I do not speak Spanish .
668,"You do not speak Bora Boran either . Besides , Mexican is easy : Donde esta el zapataria ?"
669,What doe that mean ?
670,Where is the shoe store ?
671,Donde esta el zapataria ?
672,Excellent pronunciation . You will be my little mama ceta in no time .
673,Que hora e ?
674,Que hora e ?

682,"A motorcycle movie , I am not sure the name ."
683,Are you watching it ?
684,In a way . Why ? Would you like for me to switch it off ?
685,Would you please ?
686,It is a little too early in the morning for explosion and war .

688,"How should I know , you were the one watching it ."
689,"No , imbecile , what wa your dream about ?"
690,"Oh , I ... do not remember . It is really rare I remember a dream ."
691,You just woke up from it .
692,"Fabienne , I am not lying to you , I do not remember ."
693,"Well , let is look at the grumpy man in the morning . I did not say you were lying , it is just odd you do not remember your dream . I always remember mine . Did you know you talk in your sleep ?"
694,"I do not talk in my sleep , do I talk in my sleep ?"
695,You did last night .
696,I do not know . I could not understand you .
697,Why do not you get up and we will get some breakfast at that breakfast place with the pancake .
698,One more kiss and I will get up .
699,Satisfied ? Yep .
700,"Then get up , lazy bone ."

721,"Oh it most definitely should be here , but it is not . So where is it ?"
722,"Fabienne , that wa my father is fucking watch . You know what my father went through to git me that watch ? ... I do not wan na get into it right now ... but he went through a lot . Now all this other shit , you coulda set on fire , but I specifically reminded you not to forget my father is watch . Now think , did you get it ?"

860,"Okay man , it wa a miracle , can we leave now ?"
861,"... Ever seen that show `` COPS ? `` I wa watching it once and this cop wa on it who wa talking about this time he got into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway . He unloads on this guy and he doe not hit anything . And these guy were in a hallway . It is a freak , but it happens ."

885,"I know , I know , I wa not thinking about the splatter ."
886,"Well you better be thinking about it now , motherfucker ! We got ta get this car off the road . Cops tend to notice shit like you are driving a car drenched in fucking blood ."

888,"This is the Valley , Vincent . Marsellus do not got no friendly place in the Valley ."
889,"Well , do not look at me , this is your town , Jules ."
890,Who ya callin ' ?
891,A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake .

893,"On the other side of the hill , by Burbank Studios . If Jimmie is as ai not home , I do not know what the fuck we are gon na go . I ai not got any other partner in 818 ."
894,"Listen up man , me ang my homeboy are in some serious shit . We are in a car we got ta get off the road , pronto ! I need to use your garage for a couple hour ."
895,We got ta be real fucking delicate with this Jimmie is situation . He is one remark away from kicking our ass out the door .
896,"If he kick u out , whadda we do ?"
897,"Well , we ai not leaving notil we made a couple phone call . But I never want it to reach that pitch . Jimmie is my friend and you do not bust in your friend is house and start telling 'im what is what ."
898,Just tell 'im not to be abusive . He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin .
899,"Put yourself in his position . It is eight o'clock in the morning . He just woke up , he wa not prepared for this shit . Do not forget who is doing who a favor ."
900,"If the price of that favor is I got ta take shit , he can stick his favor straight up his as ."
901,What the fuck did you just do to his towel ?
902,VINCENT
903,I wa just drying my hand .
904,You are supposed to wash 'em first .
905,You watched me wash 'em .
906,I watched you get 'em wet .
907,"I washed 'em . Blood is real hard to get off . Maybe if he had some Lava , I coulda done a better job ."
908,"I used the same soap you did and when I dried my hand , the towel did not look like a fucking Maxie pad . Look , fuck it , alright . Who care ? But it is shit like this that is gon na bring this situation to a boil . If he were to come in here and see that towel like that ... I am telling you Vincent , you best be cool . 'Cause if I got ta get in to it with Jimmie on account of you ... Look , I ai not threatening you , I respect you ang all , just do not put me in that position ."
909,"Jules , you ask me nice like that , no problem . He is your friend , you handle him ."
910,"Goddamn Jimmie , this is some serious gourmet shit . Me ang Vincent woulda been satisfied with freeze-dried Tasters Choice . You spring this gourmet fucking shit on u . What flavor is this ?"
911,"Knock it off , Julie ."
912,What ?
913,"I am not a cobb or corn , so you can stop buttering me up . I do not need you to tell me how good my coffee is . I am the one who buy it , I know how fucking good it is ."
914,"When Bonnie go shoppin ; , she buy shit . I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it , I wan na taste it . But what is on my mind at this moment is not the coffee in my kitchen , it is the dead nigger in my garage ."
915,Jimmie –
916,"I am talkin ' . Now let me ask you a question , Jules . When you drove in here , did you notice a sign out front that said , `` Dead nigger storage ? ''"
917,"answer to question . Did you see a sign out in front of my house that said , `` Dead nigger storage ? ''"
918,"( playing along ) Naw man , I did not ."
919,You know why you did not see that sign ?
920,Why ?
921,'Cause storing dead nigger ai not my fucking business !
922,"I ai not through ! Now do not you understand that if Bonnie come home and find a dead body in her house , I am gon na get divorced . No marriage counselor , no trial separation – fucking divorced . And I do not wan na get fucking divorced . The last time me ang Bonnie talked about this shit wa gon na be the last time me ang Bonnie talked about this shit . Now I wan na help ya out Julie , I really do . But I ai not gon na lose my wife doing it ."
923,Jimmie –
924,"do not fucking Jimmie me , man , I can not be Jimmied . There is nothing you can say that is gon na make me forget I love my wife . Now she is working the graveyard shift at the hospital . She will be coming home in le than an hour and a half . Make your phone call , talk to your people , than get the fuck out of my house ."
925,"That is all we want . We do not wan na fuck up your shit , We just need to call our people to bring u in ."
926,Then I suggest you get to it . Phone is in my bedroom .
927,"... well , say she come home . Whaddya think she will do ?"
928,"No fucking shit she will freak . That ai not no kinda answer . You know 'er , I do not . How bad , a lot or a little ?"
929,"You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is . If she come home from a hard day is work and find a bunch of gangster doing a bunch of gangsta ' shit in her kitchen , ai not no telling what she is apt to do ."
930,"I have grasped that , Jules . All I am doing is contemplating the `` ifs . ''"
931,"I do not wan na hear about no motherfucking `` ifs . `` What I wan na hear from your as is : `` you ai not got no problem , Jules . I am on the motherfucker . Go back in there , chill them nigger out and wait for the cavalry , which should be coming directly . ''"
932,"You ai not got no problem , Jules . I am on the motherfucker . Go back in there , chill them nigger out and wait for The Wolf , who should be coming directly ."
933,You sending The Wolf ?
934,Feel better ?
935,"Shit Negro , that is all you had to say ."

939,"You are Jimmie , right ? This is your house ?"
940,Yeah .
941,"I am Winston Wolf , I solve problem ."
942,"Good , 'cause we got one ."
943,So I heard . May I come in ?
944,Please do .
945,"You must be Jules , which would make you Vincent . Let is get down to brass tack , gentleman . If I wa informed correctly , the clock is ticking , is that right , Jimmie ?"
946,"Your wife , Bonnie ..."
947,"... come home at 9:30 in the AM , is that correct ?"
948,"I wa led to believe if she come home and find u here , she would not appreciate it none too much ."
949,She will not at that .
950,"That give use forty minute to get the fuck outta Dodge , which , if you do what I say when I say it , should by plenty . Now you got a corpse in a car , minus a head , in a garage . Take me to it ."
951,Jimmie ? Yes .
952,"Do me a favor , will ya ? Thought I smelled some coffee in there . Would you make me a cup ?"
953,"Sure , how do you take it ?"
954,"Lotsa cream , lotsa sugar ."
955,"About the car , is there anything I need to know ? Does it stall , doe it make a lot of noise , doe it smoke , is there gas in it , anything ?"
956,"Aside from how it look , the car is cool ."
957,Positive ? Do not get me out on the road and I find out the brake light do not work .
958,"Hey man , a far a I know , the motherfucker is tip-top ."
959,"Good enough , let is go back to the kitchen ."
960,"Thank you , Jimmie ."
961,"Okay first thing , you two ."
962,"( meaning Jules and Vincent ) Take the body , stick it in the trunk . Now Jimmie , this look to be a pretty domesticated house . That would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink , you got a bunch of cleaner and"
963,"cleaner and shit like that , am I correct ?"
964,Yeah . Exactly . Under the sink .
965,"Good . What I need you two fella to do is take those cleaning product and clean the inside of the car . And I am talking fast , fast , fast . You need to go in the backseat , scoop up all those little piece of brain and skull . Get it out of there ."
966,"Wipe down the upholstery – now when it come to upholstery , it do not need to be spic and span , you do not need to eat off in . Give it a good once over . What you need to take care of are the really messy part . The pool of blood that have collected , you got ta soak that shit up ."
967,"But the window are a different story . Them you really clean . Get the Windex , do a good job . Now Jimmie , we need to raid your linen closet . I need blanket , I need comforter , I need quilt , I need bedspread . The thicker the better , the darker the better . No white , can not use 'em . We need to camouflage the interior of the car . We are gon na line the front seat and the backseat and the floor board with quilt and blanket . If a cop stop u and start sticking his big snout in the car , the subterfuge will not last . But at a glance , the car will appear to be normal . Jimmie – lead the way , boy – get to work ."
968,( calling after him ) A `` please '' would be nice .
969,Come again ?
970,I said a `` please '' would be nice .
971,"Set is straight , Buster . I am not here to say `` please . `` I am here to tell you want to do . And if self-preservation is an instinct you posse , you better fucking do it and do it quick . I am here to help . If my help is not appreciated , lotsa luck gentleman ."
972,"It ai not that way , Mr. Wolf . Your help is definitely appreciated ."
973,I do not mean any disrespect . I just do not like people barking order at me .
974,"If I am curt with you , it is because time is a factor . I think fast , I talk fast , and I need you guy to act fast if you want to get out of this . So pretty please , with sugar on top , clean the fucking car ."
975,( into phone ) It is a 1974 Chevy Nova .
976,White .
977,About twenty minute .
978,Nobody who will be missed .
979,"How we comin ' , Jimmie ?"
980,"Mr. Wolf , you got ta understand something –"
981,"– Winston , Jimmie – please , Winston ."
982,"You got ta understand something , Winston . I want to help you guy out and all , but that is my best linen . It wa a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny , and they ai not with u anymore –"
983,"– let me ask you a question , if you do not mind ?"
984,Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny millionaire ?
985,No .
986,"Well , your Uncle Marsellus is . And I am positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny were millionaire , they would have furnished you with a whole bedroom set , which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do ."

991,"Man , get outta my face with that shit ! The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty-bitty piece of skull with his finger on account of your dumb as ."
992,"I got a threshold , Jules . I got a threshold for the abuse I will take . And you are crossing it . I am a race car and you got me in the red . Redline 7000 , that is where you are . Just know , it is fucking dangerous to be driving a race car when it is in the red . It could blow ."
993,"You are getting ready to blow ? I am a mushroom-cloud-laying motherfucker ! Every time my finger touch brain I am `` SUPERFLY T.N.T , '' I am the `` GUNS OF NAVARONE . '' I am"
994,"what Jimmie Walker usta talk about . In fact , what the fuck am I doing in the back ? You are the motherfucker should be on brain detail . We are tradin ' . I am washing window and you are picking up this nigger is skull ."
995,"Fine job , gentleman . We may get out of this yet ."

1061,"Yes , but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal ?"
1062,"I would not go so far a to call a dog filthy , but they are definitely dirty . But a dog is got personality . And personality go a long way ."
1063,"So by that rationale , if a pig had a better personality , he is cease to be a filthy animal ?"
1064,We would have to be talking 'bout one motherfucking charming pig . It would have to be the Cary Grant of pig .
1065,Good for you . Lighten up a little . You been sitting there all quiet .
1066,I just been sitting here thinkin ' .
1067,( mouthful of food ) About what ?
1068,The miracle we witnessed .
1069,The miracle you witnessed . I witnessed a freak occurrence .
1070,Do you know that a miracle is ?
1071,An act of God .
1072,What is an act of God ?
1073,"I guess it is when God make the impossible possible . And I am sorry Jules , but I do not think what happened this morning qualifies ."
1074,"Do not you see , Vince , that shit do not matter . You are judging this thing the wrong way . It is not about what . It could be God stopped the bullet , he changed Coke into Pepsi , he found my fucking car key . You do not judge shit like this based on merit . Whether or not what we experienced wa an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant . What is significant is I felt God is touch , God got involved ."
1075,But why ?
1076,That is what is fucking wit ' me ! I do not know why . But I can not go back to sleep .
1077,"So you are serious , you are really gon na quit ?"
1078,"The life , most definitely ."
1079,Garcon ! Coffee !
1080,"So if you are quitting the life , what will you do ?"
1081,"That is what I have been sitting here contemplating . First , I am gon na deliver this case to Marsellus . Then , basically , I am gon na walk the earth ."
1082,"What do you mean , walk the earth ?"
1083,"You know , like Caine in `` KUNG FU . '' Just walk from town to town , meet people , get in adventure ."
1084,How long do you intend to walk the earth ?
1085,Until God put me where he want me to be .
1086,What if he never doe ?
1087,"If it take forever , I will wait forever ."
1088,So you decided to be a bum ?
1089,"I will just be Jules , Vincent – no more , no le ."
1090,"No Jules , you are gon na be like those piece of shit out there who beg for change . They walk around like a bunch of fucking zombie , they sleep in garbage bin , they eat what I throw away , and dog piss on 'em . They got a word for 'em , they are called bum . And without a job , residence , or legal tender , that is what you are gon na be – a fucking bum !"
1091,"Look my friend , this is just where me and you differ –"
1092,– what happened wa peculiar – no doubt about it – but it wa not water into wine .
1093,"All shape and size , Vince ."
1094,Stop fucking talking like that !
1095,"If you find my answer frightening , Vincent , you should cease asking scary question ."
1096,I got ta take a shit . To be continued .
1097,"Everybody be cool , this is a robbery !"
1098,Any of you fucking prick move and I will execute every one of you motherfucker ! Got that ? !
1099,"Customers stay seated , waitress on the floor ."
1100,"Now mean fucking now ! Do it or die , do it or fucking die !"
1101,"You Mexicans in the kitchen , get out here ! Asta luego !"
1102,"On the floor or I will cook you as , comprende ?"
1103,"I am the manager here , there is no problem , no problem at all –"
1104,What ? You said you are gon na give me a problem ?
1105,"No , I am not . I am not gon na give you any problem !"
1106,"I do not know , Honey Bunny . He look like the hero type to me !"
1107,Do not take any chance . Execute him !
1108,Please do not ! I am not a hero . I am just a coffee shop manager . Take anything you want .
1109,Tell everyone to cooperate and it will be all over .
1110,Everybody just be calm and cooperate with them and this will be all over soon !
1111,"Well done , now git your fucking as on the ground ."
1112,"Okay people , I am going to go 'round and collect your wallet . Do not talk , just toss 'em in the bag . We clear ?"
1113,In the bag .

1125,Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst .
1126,Shoot 'em in the face !

1128,"You do not open up that case , it is gon na be the last ."
1129,"Quit causing problem , you will get u all killed ! Give 'em what you got and get 'em out of here ."

1137,"Goddammit , what is it ?"
1138,"Let him go ! Let him go ! I will blow your fucking head off ! I will kill ya ! I will kill ya ! You are gon na die , you are gon na fucking die bad !"
1139,"Tell that bitch to be cool ! Say , bitch be cool ! Say , bitch be cool !"
1140,"Chill out , honey !"
1141,Let him go !
1142,Tell her it is gon na be okay .
1143,I am gon na be okay .
1144,Promise her .
1145,I promise .
1146,Tell her to chill .
1147,Just chill out .
1148,What is her name ?
1149,Yolanda .
1150,"C amon Yolanda , what is Fonzie like ?"
1151,"( through tear , unsure ) He is cool ?"
1152,"Correct-amundo ! And that is what we are gon na be , we are gon na be cool ."
1153,"Now Ringo , I am gon na count to three and I want you to let go your gun and lay your palm flat on the table . But when you do it , do it cool . Ready ?"
1154,One ... two ... three .
1155,"Okay , now let him go !"
1156,"Yolanda , I thought you were gon na be cool . When you yell at me , it make me nervous . When I get nervous , I get scared . And when motherfucker get scared , that is when motherfucker get accidentally shot ."
1157,"( more conversational ) Just know : you hurt him , you die ."
1158,That seems to be the situation . Now I do not want that and you do not want that and Ringo here do not want that . So let is see what we can do .
1159,"Now this is the situation . Normally both of your ass would be dead a fucking fried chicken . But you appened to pull this shit while I am in a transitional period . I do not wan na kill ya , I want to help ya . But I am afraid I can not give you the case . It do not belong to me . Besides , I went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your as ."
1160,"It is cool , Vincent ! It is cool ! Do not do a goddamn thing . Yolanda , it is cool baby , nothin is changed . We are still just talkin ' ."
1161,( to Pumpkin ) Tell her we are still cool .
1162,"It is cool , Honey Bunny , we are still cool ."
1163,"What the hell is going on , Jules ?"
1164,Nothing I can not handle . I want you to just hang back and do not do shit unless it is absolutely necessary .
1165,Check .
1166,"Yolanda , how we doin , baby ?"
1167,I got ta go pee ! I want to go home .
1168,"Just hang in there , baby , you are doing ' great , Ringo is proud of you and so am I . It is almost over ."
1169,Now I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet .
1170,Which one is it ?
1171,It is the one that say Bad Motherfucker on it .
1172,That is my bad motherfucker . Now open it up and take out the cash . How much is there ?
1173,About fifteen hundred dollar .
1174,"Put it in your pocket , it is yours . Now with the rest of them wallet and the register , that make this a pretty successful little score ."
1175,"Jules , if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck , I am gon na shoot 'em on general principle ."
1176,"You ai not gon na do a goddamn thing , now hang back and shut the fuck up . Besides , I ai not giving it to him . I am buying something for my money . Wan na know what I am buying Ringo ?"
1177,What ?
1178,Your life . I am giving you that money so I do not hafta kill your as . You read the Bible ?
1179,Not regularly .
1180,There is a passage I got memorized . Ezekiel 25:17 . `` The path of the righteous man is beset on all side by the inequity of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men .
1181,"Blessed is he who , in the name of charity and good will , shepherd the weak through the valley of the darkness . For he is truly his brother is keeper and the finder of lost child . And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brother . And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you . `` I been saying that shit for year ."
1182,"And if you ever heard it , it meant your as . I never really questioned what it meant . I thought it wa just a cold- blooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his as . But I saw some shit this morning made me think twice . Now I am thinkin ' , it could mean you are the evil man . And I am the righteous man . And Mr. .45 here , he is the shepherd protecting my righteous as in the valley of darkness . Or is could by you are the righteous man and I am the shepherd and it is the world that is evil and selfish ."
1183,I would like that . But that shit ai not the truth . The truth is you are the weak . And I am the tyranny of evil men . But I am tryin ' . I am trying real hard to be a shepherd .
1184,( to himself ) It is cold .
1185,I think we oughta leave now .
1186,That is probably a good idea .
